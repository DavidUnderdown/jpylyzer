title: Release of jpylyzer 1.17.0 
---
{% include JB/setup %}

The latest version of *jpylyzer* introduces improved support for filenames that contain non-ASCII international characters. All filenames and file paths are now decoded to UTF-8. This means that, for example, filenames with Chinese, Japanese or Korean characters are now supported. See also the latest examples in the [jpylyzer test files corpus](https://github.com/openpreserve/jpylyzer-test-files).
